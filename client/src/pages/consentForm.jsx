            <p className="inter-regular">You are invited to participate in a research study conducted by Lee Branstetter at Carnegie Mellon University and  funded by the National Science Foundation.
            </p>

            <h3 className="inter-bold">Summary</h3>
            <p className="inter-regular">We are measuring student learning in community college IT and cybersecurity courses to better understand the impact of computer-based learning exercises on short-run concept mastery and long-run performance in these community programs and successful transition to work or further study.
            </p>
            <p className="inter-regular">Your participation in this research study is purely voluntary.  If you decline participation, no data will be collected by this study regarding your interaction with these exercises for the purposes of our project.
            </p>

            <h3 className="inter-bold">Purpose</h3>
            <p className="inter-regular">The purpose of the research is to better understand how learning technologies can be deployed to improve student learning in information technology and cybersecurity courses, student progress in IT and cyber security programs, and successful transitions to work or further study.
            </p>

            <h3 className="inter-bold">Procedures</h3>
            <p className="inter-regular">Students will engage directly in computer-based learning exercises that are designed to enhance comprehension and learning of key course concepts.
            </p>
            <p className="inter-regular">
                We expect that completion of each online exercise undertaken will require an hour or less.  Note that these exercises have been integrated into your courses by your instructor, so you will be required to complete these exercises for your course, whether you agree to have your data collected for our research purposes or not.
            </p>

            <h3 className="inter-bold">Participant Requirements</h3>
            <p className="inter-regular">Participation in this study is limited to individuals age 18 and older who are enrolled in IT courses offered by community colleges using CMU technology, speak English, and are physically resident in the United States at the time they participate in this study.
            </p>

            <h3 className="inter-bold">Risks</h3>
            <p className="inter-regular">The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during other online activities.  You may encounter boredom or fatigue while undertaking this activity.  There is a potential risk of breach of confidentiality.  However, we will take every precaution to protect your confidentiality by maintaining study records with personally identifiable information in password protected files on the secure Carnegie Mellon University system, to which only study team members with appropriate training will have access.  Any information shared with external researchers will be carefully deidentified.  Anonymization efforts will extend to careful writing and multiple reviews of papers and reports before publication to ensure that no participant can be tied to a particular action, reaction, or statement.</p>

            <h3 className="inter-bold">Benefits</h3>
            <p className="inter-regular">There are no direct benefits from your participation in this study.  We hope that participation will offer the opportunity to interact with useful learning technologies, which may contribute to your academic progress in targeted courses.  You may also receive an intangible benefit from contributing to research that brings benefit to the scientific community, by helping the researchers understand how educational technologies could better support and accelerate student learning in community college IT and cybersecurity courses.
            </p>

            <h3 className="inter-bold">Compensation and Costs</h3>
            <p className="inter-regular">There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.  Participants will be paid $50 for consenting to their data collection.  Participants can receive this payment as a credit to their community college student account, or as a Venmo or Paypal payment. Students who use computer-based learning exercises will do so as part of their regular class.
            </p>

            <h3 className="inter-bold">Future use of Information</h3>
            <p className="inter-regular">In the future, once we have removed all identifiable information from your data, we may use the data for our future research studies, or we may distribute the data to other researchers for their research studies.  We would do this without getting additional informed consent from you (or your legally authorized representative).  Sharing of data with other researchers will only be done in such a manner that you will not be identified.
            </p>

            <h3 className="inter-bold">Confidentiality</h3>
            <p className="inter-regular">Information collected by Carnegie Mellon regarding your use of computer-based exercises will be carefully protected.  We will keep these data in secure, password-protected file storage locations on the Carnegie Mellon computer system, which uses appropriate information security procedures to guard our data.  Only members of the study team with human subjects training will have access to these data.  The only data from these exercises that might be shared with outside researchers will be anonymized data from interaction with our that has been carefully edited to ensure the identity of the subject cannot be inferred.
            </p>
            <p className="inter-regular">We will work with the CCAC registrar and the Allegheny County Department of Human Services (ACDHS) to estimate the impact, if any, of your use of these computer-based learning exercises on the likelihood that you advance to the next required course, complete your program, transfer to a four-year program, or transition into the workforce.  CCAC has an existing data sharing agreement with ACDHS that allows authorized analysts to track the transition of CCAC students into the local workforce.  Our research team will not see your personal academic records or your employment or income records - instead the results of statistical analysis using these data will be shared with us by CCAC registrar staff and/or ACDHS analysts who are cleared to view the data.  This will preserve your privacy.  </p>
            <p className="inter-regular">Anonymization efforts will extend to the careful writing and multiple reviews of papers and reports before publication to assure that no participant can be tied to a particular activity, comment, reaction, or statement.
